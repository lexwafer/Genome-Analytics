# Enabling genome assembly in eukaryotes
The type of data to be used include Illumina reads from MiSeq and and long reads from Oxford Nanopore.
This includes:
* Checking data integrity
* Quality control
* Preprocessing (trimming and avoidance of duplicates)
* Assembly (short and long reads)
* Assessment

The data to be anlyzed in this section comes from the paper: [A chromosome-scale assembly of the smallest Dothideomycete genome reveals a unique genome compaction mechanism in filamentous fungi](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-020-6732-8 "Wang et al. BMC Genomics 21:321 (2020)").
